Losnot in paradise is a 2D video game made in Java where the main character --Los-- is located in a
strange world full of obstacles, and his mission is to get out of that place alive.

I initially wrote this game back in 2018 with the intention to develop an AI algorithm, so that the
game gets able to play on its own, and I can show the world the power of AI. I got the name of the
game influenced by Rihanna "Lost in paradise" song (which in fact it got played randomly at the
moment of pushing the initial commit to this project, and I know it's not a pure coincidence) and
also the fact that the obstacles in the game make it quite tough to overcome, so that you are
obviously lost but not precisely in paradise.

Check out the [ai branch](https://github.com/TobiasBriones/losnot-in-paradise/tree/ai) for the
algorithm that I had in mind for this game.

## Gencesk 2D

Gencesk 2D is a little 2D game framework based on Swing for Desktop games I made in 2018 in order to
create Losnot in Paradise but without using an existing framework/game engine. I leveraged the fact
that much long ago I had learned some concepts about game frameworks, so I had a nice background
about it and decided to undertake that project. I really don't want to reinvent the wheel with game
frameworks, but the main consideration I have about Gencesk is to use it as a first-line framework
for AI-for-Games research as its own name suggests it. Learn more at [Contact](#contact) / Gencesk
